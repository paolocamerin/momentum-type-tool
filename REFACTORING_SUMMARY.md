# Momentum Type Tool - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The codebase has been completely refactored to implement a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns and decouples the shader rendering pipeline from the 2D text rendering system.

## New Architecture

```

## Key Changes

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Animation Engine**: Now only handles timing, frame counting, and animation state
- **Text Renderer**: Handles all text processing, character positioning, and text rendering
- **Background Renderer**: Manages background rendering (solid color or shader)
- **Shader Manager**: Dedicated WebGL shader compilation, loading, and rendering
- **Canvas Manager**: Handles both display and shader canvas management
- **Render Pipeline**: Coordinates all rendering operations

### 2. **Decoupled Shader System**
- Shaders are completely separate from 2D text rendering
- WebGL context is managed independently
- Shader mode can be toggled without affecting text rendering
- Clean API for shader management

### 3. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Easy to test individual components
- Simple to add new features or renderers

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Graceful fallbacks for shader loading
- Proper initialization order
- Clear error messages and logging

## Module Responsibilities

### AnimationEngine
- Animation timing and frame counting
- Play/pause functionality
- Frame rate management
- Animation state tracking

### CanvasManager
- Display and shader canvas initialization
- Canvas resizing and positioning
- Context management
- Canvas layering (shader behind display)

### ShaderManager
- WebGL context management
- Shader compilation and loading
- Shader program management
- Uniform handling
- Shader rendering

### TextRenderer
- Text preprocessing and layout
- Character positioning calculations
- Font metrics and character width
- Text rendering to canvas
- Alignment handling

### BackgroundRenderer
- Background rendering logic
- Shader vs solid color mode
- Background color management

### RenderPipeline
- Coordinates all rendering operations
- Manages rendering order
- Handles mode switching
- Provides unified rendering interface

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be developed and tested independently
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new renderers or shader types
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes debugging and updates easier
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other projects
5. **Performance**: Better resource management and rendering optimization

## Usage

The refactored system maintains the same external API while providing much better internal organization. All existing functionality is preserved, but now with:

- Clean separation between 2D and WebGL rendering
- Independent shader system
- Modular architecture
- Better error handling
- Improved maintainability

## Future Enhancements

With this new architecture, it's now easy to:
- Add new shader types
- Implement additional renderers
- Add new animation effects
- Create different text layouts
- Implement advanced compositing
- Add new export formats

The modular design makes the codebase much more maintainable and extensible for future development.
